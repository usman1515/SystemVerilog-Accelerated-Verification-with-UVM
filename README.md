# SystemVerilog Accelerated Verification using UVM

This repository contains lab exercises on the YAPP packet router for the training course SystemVerilog Accelerated Verification with UVM (ver 1.2.5) offered by Cadence.

## Lab 1 - Creating a Stimulus Model
### Objective:
To use the UVM class library to create the YAPP packet data item and explore the automation provided.

## Lab 2 - Creating Test and Testbench Components
### Objective:
To start the UVM hierarchy by building the test and testbench components.

## Lab 3 - Creating a Simple UVC
### Objective:
To the front end of a UVM Verification Component (UVC) and to explore the built-in phases of uvm_component.

## Lab 4 - Using Factories
### Objective:
To create verification components and data using factory methods, and to implement test classes using configurations.

## Lab 5 - Generating UVM Sequences
### Objective:
To use the uvm_sequence mechanism to define a sequence library and to control execution of sequences.

## Lab 6 - Connecting to the DUT Using Virtual Interfaces
### Objective:
To connect the YAPP UVC to the input ports of the DUT.

## Lab 7 - Integrating Multiple UVCs
### Objective:
To connect and configure the HBUS UVC, Clock and Reset UVC and three output Channel UVCs.

## Lab 8 - Writing Multichannel Sequences and System-Level Tests
### Objective:
To build and connect multichannel sequences to your testbench.
